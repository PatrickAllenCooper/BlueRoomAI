## Problem Type
Network playground.
Letâ€™s examine the task of video recognition. A difficult problem even today. We will allow networks to express their behavior. How do we abstract useful things across network architecture.

## Research Questions
Project is intended to answer a singular prompt: How do we encode useful symbolic represenations and encode them into networks that recognize and understand the relative utility of a symbol?

We can imagine a scenario where the relative performance on a task requires composite uses of tools in a particular order? Compress problem space into symbolic transfer associations. These are recognized through an intuitive understanding of their process as heuristic.

How might we approach proximal representations of similar tasks as encoded into networks? The final results of such a system may include a series of steps. How do we converge on a singular representation of module of behavior? Is there a way to give networks relative understandings of each other and self-coordinate as cellular automata or is it necessary to have a governing body?

Relative association is a difficult task for any set of bodies to adopt, but what about a multitiude of individual cost and value functions? Networks with predefined constraints, but whose associations are allowed with infinite variability within a set of rules.
An evolutionary approach applied to a collective of individuals.

## Further Considerations
Attention awareness?
Performance on data up until a point?
How can one use relative weights?
Meta constructions through hashes. Sub-objectives. Atomization of concepts must also be available to the network.
A hash result which corresponds to the belief about performance. Awareness of similarity.
Free association will not be good enough here, but perhaps through initial free association we can hope to develop general rules to improver results.
